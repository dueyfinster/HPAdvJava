## Lab for Chapter 4 - Optional

1. Certain arithmetic operations are not defined for all possible input values. For example, division is not defined when the divisor is 0, and square root is not defined when the input value is negative.

   Write methods that implement versions of, for example, divide and square root, that return `Optional<T>` values, which indicate the presence of a valid result or no value. The methods should _not_ throw exceptions, or return `null`.

   Experiment with these methods and their returned values, for example performing further arithmetic on the results.
